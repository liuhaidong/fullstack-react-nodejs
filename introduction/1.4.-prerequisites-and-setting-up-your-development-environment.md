# 1.4. Prerequisites and Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into full stack development with React, Node.js, and TypeScript, it's important to ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites and set up your development environment. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Familiarity with these core web technologies is essential for understanding and working with React and Node.js.
* Familiarity with the command line: You should be comfortable with using command-line interfaces (CLI) for installing packages, running scripts, and managing your development environment.

2. Setting Up Your Development Environment:

* Install Node.js and NPM: Download and install the latest stable version of Node.js from the official website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)). The Node.js installer includes NPM (Node Package Manager), which you'll use to install packages and manage dependencies for your projects.
* Install a code editor: Choose a code editor that you're comfortable with and that offers good support for JavaScript and TypeScript. Popular options include Visual Studio Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), Sublime Text ([https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)), and WebStorm ([https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)). If you're using Visual Studio Code, consider installing the official TypeScript extension ([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next)) for improved TypeScript support.
* Install Git: Git is a popular version control system that helps you manage your code and collaborate with others. Download and install Git from the official website ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)). If you're new to Git, consider following a tutorial or guide to familiarize yourself with its basic concepts and commands.
*   Install TypeScript: To install TypeScript globally on your machine, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```
    Copy codenpm install -g typescript
    ```

    This will make the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) available for use in your projects.
