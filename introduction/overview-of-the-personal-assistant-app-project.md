# Overview of the Personal Assistant App project

The Personal Assistant App is a comprehensive project designed to give you hands-on experience in full stack development using TypeScript, React MUI, Node.js, SQLite, and MongoDB. Throughout the book, you will build this application step by step, applying the concepts and technologies discussed in each chapter. The app will provide users with a suite of tools to help them manage their daily tasks, events, and personal information more efficiently.

Key Features of the Personal Assistant App:

1. User Authentication: Secure user registration and login functionality with password hashing and JWT-based (JSON Web Token) authentication.
2. Task Management: Users can create, update, and delete tasks, set priorities and deadlines, and track their progress.
3. Calendar Integration: The app will include a calendar view to visualize and manage events, appointments, and deadlines.
4. Note-taking: Users can create, edit, and organize personal notes with rich-text editing capabilities and support for tags.
5. Weather Integration: Display real-time weather information based on the user's location, including current conditions and a 5-day forecast.
6. Chatbot Integration with ChatGPT API: The final module of the project will integrate the ChatGPT API, allowing users to interact with a chatbot for quick information retrieval, task and event creation, or general assistance within the app.

As you progress through the "TypeScript Full Stack Developer's Handbook," you will implement each of these features using the skills and technologies covered in the chapters. This project will not only help you gain practical experience in full stack development with TypeScript but also provide you with a valuable portfolio piece to showcase your expertise.

By the end of the book, you will have developed a fully functional Personal Assistant App with a modern, responsive user interface, a secure back-end, and seamless integration with external APIs, including the ChatGPT API. This project will serve as a testament to your newly acquired full stack development skills and demonstrate your proficiency in building robust, scalable, and feature-rich web applications.
