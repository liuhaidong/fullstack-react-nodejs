# 4. Responsive design with Material-UI

Material-UI, now known as MUI, offers various features and components that help you create responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. In this section, we will explore some of the techniques and components that you can use to build responsive web applications with MUI.

1. MUI Grid System

MUI's Grid system is a powerful layout component that allows you to create responsive designs using a 12-column layout. The Grid component consists of two main components: `Grid` and `Grid item`. The `Grid` component acts as a container for the `Grid item` components, which define how each item should be placed within the grid.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Grid, Paper } from '@mui/material';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Grid container spacing={2}>
      <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
        <Paper>Item 1</Paper>
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
        <Paper>Item 2</Paper>
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4}>
        <Paper>Item 3</Paper>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `Grid item` components have different widths based on the screen size, such as `xs={12}`, `sm={6}`, and `md={4}`. This means that on extra-small screens, each item will take up 12 columns (full width), on small screens 6 columns (half-width), and on medium screens 4 columns (one-third width).

2. Responsive Typography

MUI's theming system allows you to define responsive typography settings, which can be used throughout your application. You can specify different font sizes, line heights, and other properties based on the screen size:

```tsx
import { createTheme } from '@mui/system';

const theme = createTheme({
  typography: {
    h1: {
      fontSize: '2rem',
      '@media (min-width:600px)': {
        fontSize: '3rem',
      },
      '@media (min-width:960px)': {
        fontSize: '4rem',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In this example, the `h1` typography style has different font sizes based on the screen size, such as 2rem on extra-small screens, 3rem on small screens, and 4rem on medium screens.

3. Hidden Component

MUI provides the `Hidden` component, which helps you hide or show content based on the current screen size. You can use the `Hidden` component with the `up`, `down`, `only`, or `implementation` props to control the visibility of its child components:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Hidden } from '@mui/material';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Hidden smDown>
        <p>Visible on screens larger than small (sm).</p>
      </Hidden>
      <Hidden mdUp>
        <p>Visible on screens smaller than medium (md).</p>
      </Hidden>
    </>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the first `p` element is only visible on screens larger than small, and the second `p` element is visible on screens smaller than medium.

4. Custom Breakpoints

MUI allows you to define custom breakpoints in the theme, which can then be used in your components with the `sx` prop, `styled` function, or other styling methods:

```tsx
import { createTheme } from '@mui/system';

const theme = createTheme({
  breakpoints: {
    values: {
      xs: 0,
      sm: 600,
      md: 960,
      lg: 1280,
      xl: 1920,
      custom: 1440,
    },
  },
});
```

In this example, a custom breakpoint named `custom` is defined with a value of 1440. You can now use this breakpoint in your components:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Box } from '@mui/system';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
        '@media (min-width: 1440px)': {
          backgroundColor: 'green',
        },
      }}
    >
      Custom Breakpoint Box
    </Box>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `Box` component has a blue background color on screens smaller than the custom breakpoint (1440px) and a green background color on screens larger than the custom breakpoint.

5. Using the `useMediaQuery` Hook

MUI provides the `useMediaQuery` hook, which allows you to match the current screen size with a specific media query. This can be useful when you need to apply conditional logic based on the screen size:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useMediaQuery, Typography } from '@mui/material';
import { Theme } from '@mui/system';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const isSmallScreen = useMediaQuery((theme: Theme) => theme.breakpoints.down('sm'));

  return (
    <Typography variant={isSmallScreen ? 'h5' : 'h1'}>
      Responsive Typography
    </Typography>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `Typography` component has different variants based on the screen size, such as `h5` on small screens and `h1` on larger screens.

By utilizing these techniques and components provided by MUI, you can create responsive web applications that adapt to various devices and screen sizes. This flexibility enables you to provide an excellent user experience regardless of the device being used to access your application.
