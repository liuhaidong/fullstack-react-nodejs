# 2. Installing Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser, making it an essential tool for server-side development. npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js and is used to manage packages and dependencies for your projects. To start developing the Personal Assistant App, you'll need to install Node.js and npm on your system. Follow the steps below for your respective operating system.

Windows and macOS:

1. Visit the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)) to download the installer for your operating system. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version, as it offers greater stability and is recommended for most users.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. The installer will install both Node.js and npm on your system.
3. To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows, Terminal for macOS) and run the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the version numbers for both Node.js and npm.

Linux:

1. Open a terminal and run the appropriate command for your Linux distribution:
   *   For Ubuntu, Debian, or related distributions, use the following commands:

       ```arduino
       curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
       sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
       ```
   *   For CentOS, Fedora, or related distributions, use the following commands:

       ```arduino
       curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo bash -
       sudo yum install -y nodejs
       ```
2. To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, run the following commands in the terminal:

```shell-session
Copy codenode -v
npm -v
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the version numbers for both Node.js and npm.

Once Node.js and npm are installed on your system, you can start developing server-side applications using JavaScript or TypeScript and manage your project's packages and dependencies with ease. Throughout the "TypeScript Full Stack Developer's Handbook," you will use Node.js and npm extensively for creating and managing your Personal Assistant App project.
