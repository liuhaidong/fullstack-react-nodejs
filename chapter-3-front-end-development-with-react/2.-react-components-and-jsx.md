# 2. React components and JSX

React components and JSX are fundamental building blocks of a React application. Components are reusable, modular pieces of code that define the structure, appearance, and behavior of a specific part of the UI, while JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. In this section, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and design principles behind React components and JSX.

1. React Components

There are two types of React components: functional components and class components. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components have become more popular due to their simplicity and ease of use.

* **Functional Components**: Functional components are JavaScript functions that accept a single argument (props) and return a React element. They are stateless and have no lifecycle methods. However, with React Hooks, functional components can manage state and access lifecycle features.

Example of a functional component:

```jsx
jsxCopy codefunction Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

* **Class Components**: Class components are ES6 classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They can manage state, access lifecycle methods, and handle more complex logic. However, they tend to be more verbose and harder to read compared to functional components.

Example of a class component:

```jsx
jsxCopy codeclass Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

2. JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. It provides a more familiar and readable syntax for defining the structure and appearance of components. JSX is compiled down to regular JavaScript function calls, and it's not required to use React, but it is widely adopted for its improved readability and ease of use.

Example of JSX:

```jsx
jsxCopy codeconst element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to React and JSX!</p>
  </div>
);
```

3. JSX Expressions

JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces (`{}`). This enables you to incorporate dynamic data and logic within your components.

Example of JSX expressions:

```jsx
jsxCopy codefunction Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

4. Component Composition

React components can be composed together to build more complex UIs. You can include one component within another component, creating a hierarchy of components that work together to create the desired user interface.

Example of component composition:

```jsx
jsxCopy codefunction App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Content />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

By understanding and applying the fundamental concepts and design principles of React components and JSX, you can create modular, reusable, and maintainable frontend applications.
